<h1>Frontstore</h1>
<h2>Home Page</h2>
The name for this grocery store is GreenTree. GreenTree presents a simple but yet captivating and professional design for all pages. The navigation bar can be found on top of each page which allows the user to navigate through the pages easily. In fact, the navigation bar gives the option to search a product in the aisles, to checkout by going to the user's shopping cart and to also login to the user's account. The home page has a section for popular featured products, where different products will be displayed every time the page is refreshed. The home page also contains the different aisles to easily find a product.

<h2>Aisle and Product Pages</h2>
The aisles on the home page directly link to the corresponding aisle page which displays all products from that aisle. Each product link to a product page with more description about the product and the price per unit. The user can also modify the quantity to buy. Below the product page, there is a button that allows the user to add the product to their cart. 

<h2>Shopping Cart</h2>
The user can proceed to check out by clicking on the shopping cart in the navigation bar or by clicking the popup message when the user has successfully added a product to their cart. In the shopping cart page, the user can modify the quantity and delete an item before proceeding to the payment. The page also displays the order summary of the user which will be automatically updated whenever the quantity is changed. To proceed to payment, the user can click on the "checkout" button or on the "login to checkout" button if the user has not logged into their account.

<h2>Login and Sign Up Pages</h2>
The user can login to their account with the "Login" button that can be found in the navigation bar. The login page will display some text fields where the user must enter their username/email and password to access their account with the "login" button. A new user can create an account with the "Sign Up" button, which will redirect to a sign up page. The sign up page will prompt the user to enter a username, an email and a password to access his account. The user can complete his account creation by using the "sign up" below the text fields.

<b><h1>Backstore</h1></b>
<h2>Product List</h2>
The product list in the backstore part of the website, lists all products available in the store with a global summary for each one of them. The buttons to edit their summary or delete them completely can be found on this page as well. Another button present on the product list page is the "Add Product" button, and it gives a direct access to a different page in which the user would be able to give the title of the product, associate it to a category of products, give the supplier, add the quantity stored, decide of the price, give a description, and even upload an image of the product from his personal computer.

<h2>Order List</h2>
In the order list, examples of different orders are given with essential information like the date of the purchase, the name of the buyer, the subtotal, the profit to the store, and the order's status. Buttons "View" and "Ship" allow the user to have some control over the order. The "View" button is linked to another page where the whole information about the buyer's profile is shown as well as the shipping address and the order's summary that can be altered by the user. The buttons "Cancel" and "Save" on the top of the order will be implemented later.

<h2>User List</h2>
The user list allows the user to see all the accounts created by customers, and buttons "Edit" and "Delete" will give some control over the list later. The "Add User" button, on the other hand is linked to a page which would allow to enter all necessary information to create a new account.
